# SQL Server CDC to BigQuery using Dataflow

This repository contains a custom pipeline to stream **Change Data Capture (CDC)** data from SQL Server to **Google BigQuery**, using **Apache Beam (Dataflow)**, without Kafka or Debezium.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This pipeline reads changes from SQL Server's log-based CDC tables (e.g., `cdc.fn_cdc_get_all_changes_<table>`) and streams them directly to BigQuery. It is ideal for teams who want a simplified CDC architecture with:

- **No Kafka**, **No Pub/Sub**, and **No Debezium**
- End-to-end data flow using only **SQL Server + Dataflow + BigQuery**
- Low-latency change propagation and simplified operations
